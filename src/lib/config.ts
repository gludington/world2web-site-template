// collection of entries. This is the mechanism that lets a site-wide
// setting (chosen once, in Foundry) reach an already-deployed site without
// any git action: it rides the same publish button that's already pushing

// chunk under dist/.prerender/chunks/, losing its real source location) is
// reliable here. See astro.config.mjs for why its own import.meta.url is.
